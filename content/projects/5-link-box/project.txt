Title: Link.box

----

Brief: 

The idea for Link.box was conceived as a direct result of my learning process at Panter. 

At the very beginning of the Praktikum I began by setting myself goals of the topics that I wanted to cover during the 6 months. Using a spreadsheet I then began allocating resources I had found on the web ie. links to those topics. As Severin would suggest links for me to explore during our crit sessions I would save them into the library of links and allocate them to a topic.

The aim of Link.box was to create basic functions of a link.library that could be used to collect, manage, search, prioritise resources that were relevant to the topics you aimed to cover in your Ausbildung or Praktikum. The long term intention being a tool that supervisors and Praktikants could take blueprints from previous users to collaboratively put together a unique learning track of topics to be covered and the resources relevant to achieve those goals .
