2018 is turning into a historic year for Sandra Oh. The Korean-Canadian actor has been a fixture since 2005, when she strode onto TV screens as Dr Cristina Yang, the foil to Dr Meredith Grey in Grey’s Anatomy. But it’s only now, as Eve Polastri in the wildly successful spy thriller Killing Eve, that Sandra is garnering acclaim in a prime-time leading role — and has received the first-ever best actress Emmy nomination for a female actor of Asian descent.

She knows it’s just one small step, but the hilarious Sandra, 47, plans to play her part.
