Title: Link Box

----

Brief: 

Problem 
Praktikants need to work independently to achieve their learning goals at Panter. Supervisors have many good suggestions of which resources could be helpful in doing so.  For each new Praktikant or Ausbildungsprogramm this process is repeated from scratch with no overlap or profit from sharing of previous people's research and findings.

Solution
Create a resource management tool which defines Topics (ie. Learning goals) and allows you to allocate and prioritise appropriate links to them.

Aim
To learn and implement the Software design process from start to end on a small scale in order to familiarise myself with the different steps of the process and explore the various tools and skills involved.
