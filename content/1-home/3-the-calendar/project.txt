Title: The Campaign-Calendar with Gabriella

----

Brief: 

The Calendar brief was to create a marketing tool that could be used to reveal content to an audience over a period of time -- for example an advent calendar. 

Taking into account my considerable lack of enthusiasm for the obligatory celebration commonly referred to as Christmas, I decided instead to create a calendar to celebrate the lead up to international womans day. 

Each day would reveal one inspirationally badass female  from history and a link for further investigation .
