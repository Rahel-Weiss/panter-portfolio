Title: The calendar

----

Brief: The Calendar brief was to create a marketing tool that could be used to reveal content over a period of time -- for example an advent calendar. Taking into account my considerable displeasure of the event we've become obligated to participate in I decided instead to create a calendar to celebrate the lead up to international womans day. Each day I would reveal one inspirational female badass from history and a link to explore their story further.
