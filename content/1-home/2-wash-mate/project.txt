Title: Wash Mate - An app for future Miele washing machines & tumble dryers

----

Brief: 

Problem: In Switzerland people living in inner city apartments usually share laundry facilities in the basement. A tenant has to go to the basement to see if the machine is free, potentially wasting time.

Solution: Miele creates a mobile app to inform all people that share a washing machine or tumble dryer if the machine is currently running and when it will become available again. Like that, people save the time of going to the basement to find out if the machine is taken.

Task: 
- Define the problem & the usage of the app. 
- Write user stories.
- Design the flow
- Create a clickable prototype.
