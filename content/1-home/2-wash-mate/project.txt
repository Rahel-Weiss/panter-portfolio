Title: Wash Mate - An app for Miele washing machines & tumble dryers

----

Brief: 

Problem: People living in inner city apartments usually share laundry facilities in the basement and tenants have to go to the basement to see if the machine is available.

Solution: Miele creates a mobile app to inform people who share a washing machine or tumble dryer wether the machine is currently running and when it will become available again. 

Task: 
- Define the problem & the usage of the app. 
- Write user stories.
- Design the flow.
- Create a clickable prototype.
