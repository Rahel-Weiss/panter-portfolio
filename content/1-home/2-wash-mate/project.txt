Title: Wash Mate - An app for all future Miele washing machines and tumble dryers

----

Brief: 

Problem: In Switzerland people living in inner city apartments usually share laundry facilities in the basement. A tenant has to go to the basement to see if the machine is free, potentially wasting time.

Solution: Miele creates a mobile app to inform all people that share a washing machine or tumble dryer if the machine is currently running and when it will become available again. Like that, people save the time of going to the basement to find out if the machine is taken.

## Stories
- A user downloads the app and connects a machine
> 1. Scans Serial number
> 2. Establishing Connection
> 3. User is informed about the successful connection
- A user can check the current state of a shared washing machine.
> 1. User sees that the machine is running and the time left
> 2. User sees that the machine is free
- A user adds a second machine
- A user deletes a machine from the list
- (User can invite other wash mates)
