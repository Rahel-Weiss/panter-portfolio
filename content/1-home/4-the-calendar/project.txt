Title: The Campaign-Calendar with Gabriella

----

Brief: 

Brief
Create a marketing tool that could be used to reveal content to an audience over a period of time â€“ for example an advent calendar. 

Task
Design the calendar
Implement the design with frontend tools - CSS & Javascript
Collaboration with Gabriella to produce the final product.

Outcome
Gabriella built the structure with React & connected to Magnolia CMS.
I applied my css and javascript learnings to implement the frontend

Next Steps
Data structure is already in place by Gabriella but front end needs to be added so that the squares which have been revealed show a portrait of the woman behind it. The end result would be a line up of faces similar to a class portrait show ing all the woman featured.
