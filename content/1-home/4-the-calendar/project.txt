Title: The Campaign-Calendar with Gabriella

----

Brief: 

The Calendar brief was to create a marketing tool that could be used to reveal content to an audience over a period of time â€“ for example an advent calendar. 

Considering my lack of enthusiasm for the obligatory celebration commonly referred to as Christmas and the limited resources available I decided instead to create a calendar to celebrate the lead up to International Womans Day. 

Each day would reveal one inspirational female from history and a link to further investigate her achievements.
